# My Portfolio project

## Overview

This project aims to showcase my professional profile and experience through an online resume. It provides a platform for potential employers, clients, or collaborators to learn more about my skills, education, work experience, and projects.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the Astro framework, a modern static site generator for building fast websites with the ability to add a javascript framework. Astro allows for the creation of highly performant web applications with server-side rendering and static site generation, which is perfect for content driven sites such as a resume.
